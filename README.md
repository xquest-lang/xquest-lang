xQuest is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for supporting a **Question Driven Approach**.

## The Core Idea: Software Development, A Learning Process.

### Knowledge
Software is a storage medium for knowledge. 

If you don't believe it, just think about what you need to create 
a personal home page. Today, you even need to know TCP, IP, HTTP, CSS or any programming ability at all. It's bloody simple.

Well, now imagine you're in 1985. What would you have to develop? Little tip: Wikipedia: "History of the Internet". 
Almost everything has to be developed, invented. All the web frameworks, HTML, HTTP, CSS, JavaScript, ... .

We stand on the shoulders of giants.

Summary: Software is a storage medium for knowledge or  **Software is Knowledge**.

If Software is Knowledge, you need first gain the knowledge.

### Learning

You can't really program what you don't understand. You have to have insights.

Of course, if someone else has already has written it in a foreign programing language, you might think: 
Hey. I just translate it. So it's not necessary anymore to understand this. You're right, but in the first
place the origin author has to understand the problem and then he/she solved it. Then you are just a copycat, a plagiariser.

But the moment you want to enhance, adapt, improve or even just fix a bug of _your_(?) solution: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT!

So here we are: Developing Software is gaining knowledge, having insights 
and then encode this within your favorite programming language. 

Or better: **Software development is a learning process**.
